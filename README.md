# Real Estate & Machine Learning

Two days ago I've desided to play with data, try to predict/validate real estate price.

### Plan
1. Mine data
2. Choose algorithm
3. Train model
4. Predict/validate price by the model

### Tools
1. [WebScraper Chrome extension](https://www.webscraper.io/)
2. MS Office Excel (or any tools which can effectively use manipulate css files)
3. [Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://studio.azureml.net)
